## Hey there 👋

I'm currently working on growing my GitHub with useful, well-documented projects.

- 🌱 Learning Python — especially automation and AI development
- 🛠️ Currently building: Python-based automation tools for productivity
- 🤝 Open to collaborating on open source tools and Python scripts


I also tinker with game development on itch.io, where I build small Unity/C# projects to sharpen my skills and explore game design.
